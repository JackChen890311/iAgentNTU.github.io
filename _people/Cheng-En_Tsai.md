Hi, I'm Cheng-En. You can also call me Charin.
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree at the Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University. I received my master’s degree in Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology in 2022 and bachelor’s degree in history from National Dong Hwa University in 2017.
My research interests are natural language processing, extended reality, and interactive digital narrative. Now I am working on creating reliable narrative companion robots for the elderly.
