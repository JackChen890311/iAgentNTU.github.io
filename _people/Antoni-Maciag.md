<br />

Greetings! I'm a Master's student at NTU CSIE, where I'm trying to do some cool research in Natural Language Processing. I don't have a thesis topic yet, though. Before coming here, I got a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Warsaw. I also have experience as a Bachelor's thesis intern and Python dev.

In my spare time I make some music and try to improve my Chinese to survive living in Taipei.
